# Project Trybers and Dragons

Hello! Welcome to the Trybers and Dragons project repository. In this project, you will apply the principles of the SOLID architecture and the principles of OOP in a framework of role-playing games, known as RPG (Role Playing Game).

## Mandatory Requirements Developed

1. I created the `Race` class to represent the races of the characters in the game.

2. I created classes that inherit from the `Race` class to represent specific races in the game.

3. I created the `Energy` interface to represent the energy of the characters in the game.

4. I created the `Archetype` class to represent the archetypes of the characters in the game.

5. I created classes that inherit from the `Archetype` class to represent specific archetypes in the game.

6. I created the `Fighter` interface to represent the fighters in the game.

7. I created the `Character` class to represent the characters in the game.

8. I created the `SimpleFighter` interface to represent simple fighters in the game.

9. I created the `Monster` class to represent the game's monsters.

10. I created the `PVP` class to represent the combat between two characters.

Bonus Requirements

11. I created the `PVE` class to represent the combat between a character and a monster.

12. I created the `Dragon` class to represent the dragon in the game.

13. I created objects in the `index.ts` file to simulate the interaction between characters, monsters and dragon.

Thanks for checking out my Trybers and Dragons project. Now you have a class structure for an RPG game, where you can create characters, races, archetypes, fighters, monsters and carry out combats between characters, between a character and a monster, and even face a dragon. Use the objects created in the `index.ts` file to simulate the interaction between these entities. If you have any questions or need help, I'm here to help.
